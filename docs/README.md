# ServiceBlock

This library gives you a declarative approach to defining REST APIs. It's based on ASP.NET, but gives your a resource oriented workflow.

The purpose of this library is not to provide customizability. Rather, it's to reduce a lot of the noise that comes with setting up a micro-service, allowing the developer to focus on writing business logic.
